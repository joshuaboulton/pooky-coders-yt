This is the code used during the creation of the video of coding a neural network from scratch.



## Run Locally

Clone the project by typing these lines in the terminal

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/pooky1955/pooky-coders-yt
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd pooky-coders-yt/nne-11-nn-from-scratch
```



Install Pandas and Jupyter Lab

```bash
  pip install jupyterlab
  pip install pandas
```
or you can also use Conda if you have it installed: Here's my [video](https://youtu.be/MXRPpXy-4ew) on how to set it up.
